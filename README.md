# Pong
This code follows the Pong project from the CS50’s Introduction to Game Development course.


## Objectives
- [x] Read and understand all of the Pong source code from Lecture 0.
- [x] Implement a basic AI for either Player 1 or 2 (or both!).


## Running the Game
This game is built using the [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/) framework. To run the game, you'll need to have LÖVE installed on your machine.

You can follow the [Getting Started](https://love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started) guide on the LÖVE website to install the framework and run the game.

Once LÖVE is installed, you can start the game by navigating to the game's directory and running the following command in your terminal:

```
love .
```

Upon starting the game, you will be presented with a menu to select the game mode. Use the arrow keys to navigate the menu and press Enter to select the desired mode.


## Game Modes
The game includes three modes of play:
- **Player vs Player**: Two players compete against each other, each controlling a paddle with the keyboard.
- **Player vs AI**: A single player competes against the computer's AI.
- **AI vs AI**: Watch as two AI players compete against each other.
